== MAP MY READS

Production link: http://www.mapmyreads.com

MAP MY READS started as a three-week solo project while I was at the Turing School. Three weeks goes by really quickly. What's still left to do:

* Use Google Maps API to show a map of a user's reading history
* Rework menu button into something much less clunky
* Add to-read functionality
* Tidy up responsive design
* Figure out a best-practice way to test through the jQuery
* NYPL API integration?
